# pandas Demos

Example code using the Python `pandas` package for demonstration and (educational) reference.

The `pandas` library provides a `Series`, `DataFrame`, and `MultiIndexDataFrame` set of utility functions and classes for organising, accessing, and processing tabular data (JSONs, CSVs, Parquet files, _etc._). Some of the syntax and implementation is non-standard in comparison to most Python code, so this reference repository should be a helpful means of pointing out some of the quirks of using `pandas`.

I created this repository to help remind myself how the `pandas` syntax works, and to test out some other features. This is available for general reference, in case it's helpful to anyone else.
