# `pandas` for Data Analytics & Engineering

__tommy teaches tommy__ (_and anyone else who cares to read all this_) about software development and coding with the [`pandas`]( https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) third-party package in Python for managing and manipulating data with varying levels of complexity.

The `pandas` library provides a `Series`, `DataFrame`, and `MultiIndexDataFrame` set of utility functions and classes for organising, accessing, and processing tabular data (JSONs, CSVs, Parquet files, _etc._). Some of the syntax and implementation is non-standard in comparison to most Python code, so this reference repository should be a helpful means of pointing out some of the quirks of using `pandas`.

## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

_"What's in a name?"_

You can see a rambly explanation [here at my personal website](https://tommypkeane.com/about-tommy/tommy-teaches-tommy.html); but, in short:

I'm just trying to say that I'm writing out what I think is helpful/interesting to me, and I'm sharing it in case it's helpful to anyone else, but please know that I'm ___not___ trying to talk _down_ to anyone :smile: (except maybe myself :ghost:).
